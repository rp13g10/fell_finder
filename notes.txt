To Do

Address any todos added in the code
Continue tidying up page formatting
Plots need wrapping up into components, get rid of generators.py
Plots need jazzing up a bit
Tidy up code (linting, comments, etc)
Clear out any unused code (grid should be able to go)
Put something on the homepage
Consider adding a popup while routes are generating (or some sort of loading indicator)

Improve handling of cycle paths, combine with the 'foot' tag to determine if shared usage is intended
Run profiling for long route creation, seems to be a lot of single-cpu time
If surface restrictions not satisfied, process without restriction and return the closest match?
Move auto-tuning of max candidates into rust code
