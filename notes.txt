Next Steps:

Move all dataclasses into single folder
Tidy up structure for routing code
Implement filtering by surface ratio
Build out tests for all routing code

Proposed changes

- Route class needs to keep track of its geometry
  - Reimplement as a standard class, use slots to optimise footprint
  - Zimmer can handle this as it already keeps graph as attribute
- Add gain/loss potential as properties based on internal geometry
- Update ratio property to factor in gain/loss potential
- Update function to generate new route IDs to include timestamp
- Remove extra timestamp from app element IDs as it's no longer required
- Add step_to_next_node as method
- Add surface ratios as property
- Update routeselector to accept routeconfig, set params accordingly
